# License Justification

In this project, We have chosen the MIT License because it is widely known, non-copyright license,and provides maximum freedom for developers and users.
This license is one of the most popular and used in the world of open-source projects both among individuals, and organizations, and communities. 
Thus, its bare bones, clear language approach gives a great basis for open work, sharing and advancing.

There is increasead usage of  MIT License as it limits the options of using the software by setting very few conditions on the users. 
The users and developers are permitted to copy, modify, and distribute it in open source software and also in commercial software. 
This makes the license good for those projects which are interested in being used and created by a as many people and organisations as possible.

The few prerequisites that it established for the use by the users, including recording of the original copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty, are rather easy to meet. 
It also assists in reducing the hurdles of adoption hence; other developers are free to include the project in their work without having to worry much about legal issues or conditionality. 
This is especially helpful in terms of encouraging people to contribute, as they understand that the materials they create will be used,
and can be used in any way without specific rules limiting the project’s development.

From the contributor’s side, the MIT License is widely used because with its help, a large number of use cases can be provided while requiring attribution to the original authors. 
Authors and contributors may be confident that the contributions they make to a Free Software project will remain linked to them,
even as those contributions are adapted, copied or extended for consumption by the greater software community.

Also, the MIT License is fully compliant with the concept of open source.
This license does not limit how the software can be combined with other open source softwares, hence accomodating a wide range of operating systems.
This level of compatibility is now an imperative for today’s development environments where an application may use open source API’s to working with developed application code.
As a result, the MIT License eliminates confusion as to specific paths of its usage and provides easier compatibility with other development workflows.

There is one more important factor that encourages to choose MIT License becuase of its simplicity and openness.
The legal writing used is simple and straightforward: even a developer less inclined toward law could get what was said.
This has clarity implications because it means that users and contributors can understand what they are allowed or disallowed to do about the project.

Therefore, we have chosen the MIT License as the best solution: a tone of freedom and flexibility together with appropriate responsibility for the created product.
This makes it easy to use, and share while its tolerance allows the project to adapt and develop in a number of contexts and in fields, ranging from open-source projects and commerce to academia.
